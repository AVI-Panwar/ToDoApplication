# To-Do List Application

A simple and efficient To-Do List application developed using Java Spring Boot. This application allows users to manage tasks with features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting to-do items. The tasks are managed with fields for title, date, and status, and the data is persisted using Microsoft MSSQL Server.
